# Minimal-MinGW-GCC-9.1
Binaries for MinGW with GCC 9.1 and binutils

These binaries were built with the scripts and components from https://github.com/StephanTLavavej/mingw-distro. Massive shoutout. Changes made from the original scripts are the exclusions of all non needed libraries for a smaller footprint and since I prefer compiling them myself, enabling DLLs to also be built and the exclusions of the patches that were previously applied as those werent needed anymore with GCC 9.1 instead of 8.2.
